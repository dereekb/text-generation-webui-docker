# Introduction
This project dockerises the deployment of [oobabooga/text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) and its variants. It provides a default configuration (corresponding to a vanilla deployment of the application) as well as pre-configured support for other set-ups (e.g., latest `llama-cpp-python` with GPU offloading, the more recent `triton` and `cuda` branches of GPTQ).

*This goal of this project is to be to [oobabooga/text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), what [AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker](https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker) is to [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).*

# Usage
*This project currently supports Linux as the deployment platform. It will also probably work using WSL2.*

## Pre-Requisites
- docker
- docker compose
- CUDA docker runtime

## Docker Compose
This is the recommended deployment method.

### Select variant
Choose the desired variant by specifying the profile to use. These are the options:

| Variant | Description | 
|---|---|
| `default` | Minimal implementation of the default deployment from source.  |
| `triton` | Updated GPTQ using the latest `triton` branch from `qwopqwop200/GPTQ-for-LLaMa`. Suitable for Linux only. |
| `cuda` | Updated GPTQ using the latest `cuda` branch from `qwopqwop200/GPTQ-for-LLaMa`. |
| `monkey-patch` | Use LoRas in 4-Bit GPTQ mode. |
| `llama-cublas` | CUDA GPU offloading enabled for llama-cpp. Use by setting option `n-gpu-layers` > 0. |

*See: [oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/main/docs/GPTQ-models-(4-bit-mode).md](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/main/docs/GPTQ-models-(4-bit-mode).md) and [obabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/main/docs/llama.cpp-models.md](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/main/docs/llama.cpp-models.md) for more information on variants.*

### Run the Image
To run a specific variant image:

```
docker compose --profile [variant] up --build
# where [variant] is one of: default | triton | cuda | monkey-patch | llama-cublas
```

### Remove
Remove a service:

```
docker compose --profile [variant] down -v
```

## Configuration
These configuration instructions describe the relevant details for this docker wrapper. Refer to [oobabooga/text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) documentation for usage of the application itself.

### Ports
Three commonly used ports are available:

|  Port  | Description |
|  ----  | ----------- |
| `7860` | Web UI port |
| `5000` | API port    |
| `5005` | Streaming port |

Only port `7860` is exposed by default. Modify `docker-compose` to bind the other ports.

*Extensions may use additional ports - check the application documentation for more details.*

### Volumes
The provided example docker compose maps several volumes from the local `config` directory into the container: `loras, models, presets, prompts, softprompts, training`. If these folders are empty, they will be initialised when the container is run.

*If you are getting an error about missing files, try clearing these folders and letting the service re-populate them.*

### Extra launch arguments
Extra launch arguments can be defined in the environment variable `EXTRA_LAUNCH_ARGS` (e.g., `"--model MODEL_NAME"`, to load a model at launch). The provided default extra arguments are `--verbose` and `--listen` (which makes the webui available on your local  network) and these are set in the `docker-compose.yml`.

*Launch arguments should be defined as a space-separated list, just like writing them on the command line. These arguments are passed to the `server.py` module.*

### Updates
These projects are moving quickly! To update to the latest version, rebuild the image without cache:

`docker compose build --no-cache`

*When the container is launched, it will print out how many commits behind origin the current build is, so you can decide if you want to update it.*

### Developers / Advanced Users
The Dockerfile can be easily modified to compile and run the application from a local source folder. This is useful if you want to do some development or run a custom version. See the Dockerfile itself for instructions on how to do this.

*Support is not provided for this deployment pathway. It is assumed that you are competent and willing to do your own debugging! Pro-tip: start by placing a `text-generation-webui` repo into the project folder.*

## Standalone Container
NOT recommended, instructions are included for completeness.

### Build
Build the image for the default target:

`docker build --target default -t text-generation-webui:local .`

### Run
Run a container (and destroy it upon completion):

`docker run --it --rm -p 7860:7860 text-generation-webui:local`

# Contributions
Contributions are welcomed - please feel free to submit a PR. More variants (e.g., AMD/ROC-M support) and Windows support can help lower the barrier to entry, make this technology accessible to as many people as possible, and push towards democratising the severe impacts that AI is having on our society.
